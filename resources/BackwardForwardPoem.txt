Today was the absolute worst day ever
And don't try to convince me that
There's something good in every day
Because, when you take a closer look,
This world is a pretty evil place.
Even if
Some goodness does shine through every once in a while
Satisfaction and happiness don't last.
And it's not true that 
It's all in the mind and heart
Because
True happiness can be obtained
Only if one's surroundings are good
It's not true that good exist
I'm sure that you can agree that
The reality
Creates
My attitude
It's all beyond my control
And you'll never in a million years hear me say that
Today was a good day
